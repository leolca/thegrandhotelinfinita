Scotch barked and started to run, pulling Anne along. He was clearly excited! They took the stairs and up, and up, and up they went, passing countless rooms and moving from one floor to another. They visited one specific room and found the walrus's missing pipe. Taking the stairs again, they found the scarf, then the wristwatch, the football boots, and the bear's suspenders. After a finite time, visiting a countable number of rooms on many different floors, all the precious items were finally retrieved.

The mystery of the missing heirlooms was solved! The walrus, with a puff on his pipe, declared that Anne was an honorary member of the Arctic Bocce Club for her quick thinking. The owl gifted her a golden bookmark as a sign of recognition for her remarkable skills. The giraffe invited her to an upcoming ski season in the Alps. The rabbit took his medicine, for he was already late, and after feeling relief, gave Anne a warm hug. The bear, now happily wearing his suspenders, gave a mighty cheer and gave Scotch some dog biscuits for his help in solving the puzzle. Henrietta offered Anne a free night at the hotel. Bernard said he would never, ever forget to check and make sure the freight elevator was completely empty before he sent a new guest's belongings on their way. And the pig... well, he ran off without saying goodbye, because his football match had already started.
